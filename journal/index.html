            <h1>Analyzing Images</h1>

            <article>
                <p>Chao's image is taken from the inside of his car while driving down the road. The mysterious, foggy atmosphere of the landscape is supposed to represent the emptyness of a space without people in it. To me, this photo is also about reflection, and the journey into the vast unknown. I like how the beam of light disappears into the horizon line, creating an interesting composition. What's interesting about this photo is the contrast between the bright lights of the car and the dark, distorted background with the trees. It makes me wonder why this person is out in the middle of the night? Where are they driving to? Are they driving alone? I think this photo is a great jumping off point for this project, especially if Chao decides to lean into a more desolate and eerie theme. I would consider finding similar photos with the same blur effect or stark contrast, which may help tie every together even more. </p>

                <p>Of the photos in my project so far, I found this one to be the most interesting, both for its composition and emotion. This photo was taken of my sister when we were touring a government building in Alaska. We were leaving to get lunch when I thought it would be nice to capture her going down this dynamic rectangular staircase. This photo relates to my collection because it makes you wonder where this person is going and why they are in the space that they are in. With my project, I want to provoke that thought exercise by including a small insight into what this person is thinking about. I've always been interested in understanding people's experiences and what their inner worlds look like, as everyone is going through something different. I hope this project pique's other's interest as well. In terms of improvements, I want to edit the photo to have a stronger visual focus on the person. I may also add a filter to the photo to emphasize surrealness and introspection. </p>

                <p>Effective photography evokes thoughtful interpretation. The article, "10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills" describes students engaging with the question: What's going on in this picture? They found that students were more creative in their observations, and were able to notice small details in the photographs that they analyzed. Photography not only tells what's going on, but alludes to deeper context and meanings. For website designers, this makes photography a powerful tool to highlight themes or evoke emotions in users. </p>

                <h2>the ciridae website</h2>
                <p>The ciridae website uses photography and interaction design to beautifully display its services. The page scrolls smoothly while incorporating fun and unique ways for viewers to explore its content. It uses photography that is both natural and ethreal to represent the flow of innovation. The feel is systematic, but also bright and authentic. The design gives users a sense that this company is using techonology to grow and change organically over time. </p>

                <p>I learned how to create a successful modal after reading the article, "Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows", by Naema Baskanderi. A successful modal gets the user to answer a prompt without the user exiting the window. Modal windows should be used to grab a user's attention and show additional information, without causing more confusion for the user. Key features of a good overlay include having well-labeled CTA buttons, large enough text for readability, a close button for navigation, and a lightbox effect for clarity. I will be using these tips in the future to create my own overlays and ensure that users have the best experience possible!</p>

            <article>
                <p>Form design is all about being human-centered. Designing a form requires the designer to consider the detailed interactions between the user and the website. It asks the designer to create usable experiences for users of various backgrounds, including those with visual impairments and other disabilities. This is important because it allows for the best possible experience, with minimal stressors and strong accessibility for users, and ensures that users complete the form in its entirety. Creating accessible forms is what empathetic design is all about: understanding how the user moves through a page and designing features that heighten that experience.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>a great form is...</h2>
                <p>It’s valuable to keep a form short, including only the fields that are necessary, so that users don’t exit the form. How an input field is designed can make or break a user’s decision to continue filling out the form. Asking easy questions first, distinguishing required fields, and intentionally setting the width of a field are all good ways of boosting user retention. Autofocusing the first input field and properly labeling fields helps the user to navigate through the page and answer fields more easily.
                </p>

                <p>A form’s layout can also determine the user’s ease of navigation. Specific call-to-action buttons, matching alphabetical/numerical keyboard, form completion/error feedback, and progress bar all show the user what needs to be input and how specifically completion can be achieved.

                <h2>an example</h2>
                <p>One example of good form design is Headspace’s sign-in/create account feature. For a company that promotes stress-free and soothing lifestyles, I think they depicted it well in their sign-in process. The number of input fields is limited, requiring users to enter only their name, email, and password. Required asterisks and labels clearly define what the user needs to input. Action buttons are labeled specifically, with “Sign-up” and “Create an Account”. I also like that there is user feedback for incorrect input, like “Hmm, try double-checking your email” for an invalid email address. Additionally, users can also show and hide their password instead of having to input it twice.</p>
