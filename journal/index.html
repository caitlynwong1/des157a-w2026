                <p>I learned how to create a successful modal after reading the article, "Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows", by Naema Baskanderi. A successful modal gets the user to answer a prompt without the user exiting the window. Modal windows should be used to grab a user's attention and show additional information, without causing more confusion for the user. Key features of a good overlay include having well-labeled CTA buttons, large enough text for readability, a close button for navigation, and a lightbox effect for clarity. I will be using these tips in the future to create my own overlays.</p>

                <p>Form design is all about being human-centered. Designing a form requires the designer to consider the detailed interactions between the user and the website. It asks the designer to create usable experiences for users of various backgrounds, including those with visual impairments and other disabilities. This is important because it allows for the best possible experience, with minimal stressors and strong accessibility for users, and ensures that users complete the form in its entirety. Creating accessible forms is what empathetic design is all about: understanding how the user moves through a page and designing features that heighten that experience.</p>

                <h2>a great form is...</h2>
                <p>It’s valuable to keep a form short, including only the fields that are necessary, so that users don’t exit the form. How an input field is designed can make or break a user’s decision to continue filling out the form. Asking easy questions first, distinguishing required fields, and intentionally setting the width of a field are all good ways of boosting user retention. Autofocusing the first input field and properly labeling fields helps the user to navigate through the page and answer fields more easily.
                </p>

                <p>A form’s layout can also determine the user’s ease of navigation. Specific call-to-action buttons, matching alphabetical/numerical keyboard, form completion/error feedback, and progress bar all show the user what needs to be input and how specifically completion can be achieved.

                <h2>an example</h2>
                <p>One example of good form design is Headspace’s sign-in/create account feature. For a company that promotes stress-free and soothing lifestyles, I think they depicted it well in their sign-in process. The number of input fields is limited, requiring users to enter only their name, email, and password. Required asterisks and labels clearly define what the user needs to input. Action buttons are labeled specifically, with “Sign-up” and “Create an Account”. I also like that there is user feedback for incorrect input, like “Hmm, try double-checking your email” for an invalid email address. Additionally, users can also show and hide their password instead of having to input it twice.</p>
